# Advent of Code Solutions

https://adventofcode.com/

This repository contains my solutions for **Advent of Code**, the annual December programming challenge series.  
Solutions are organized by **year**, then by **day**.

## Folder Structure

The layout for each year looks like this:

```

./2025/
    Day1/
        input
        problem.md
        solution1
        solution2
    Day2/
        ...
./2026
    ...

```

### Structure Details

- **input** — the puzzle input for that part  
- **problem.md** — the full problem text for reference  
- **solution[1-2]** — implementation for solving that specific part (language may vary)

Each part is independent and includes everything needed to run or review that specific solution.
